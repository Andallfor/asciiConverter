# Hello this is my attempt at making a program that converts pics to ascii

idk what im doing so excuse the shitty code

 (its not plagrism its inspiration)


# Info
its uh pretty bad, since the dataset im using only has letters + numbers

additionally i could only get the ai to an 85% success rate


really only does basic images, such as the two i provided

the square is by far the best, since i created it to be able to work

the triangle is like 50%? so good enough ig


this was really just a test to see if i kinda know what im doing with super basic ann so i dont think imma be touching this after or anything

so itll just stay useless pog
